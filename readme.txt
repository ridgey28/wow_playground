******************Welcome*******************

Welcome to the PHP Jquery Form Tutorial

1.  Edit the class-databasehelpers.php file in the lib directory.
    Enter your MYSQL Username, Password and the name of your database.
    DB_SERVER is usually localhost!
    Please make sure there are no spaces as this will throw a error.


2.  Upload to your website and then use your web browser to find the setup file (setup.php)
    This could be http://localhost/wow_playground/php/setup.php

3.  Click on setup and this will create your database and re-direct you to index.php in the root directory. Please note that after the database has been correctly setup, the setup.php file will be renamed as it's a potential security risk.
